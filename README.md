This repository contains a demonstration of the `worker_threads` module that is now standard in **Node 11.7.0**. To make things interesting, I am using **Rxjs** `Observable` stream messages from the worker thread.

This demo requires **Node 11.7.0** or higher.

To run the demo, run `npm install` then `npm start`.
